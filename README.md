Webmap of Worcester Public Resources

By Ethan Manley, Alvaro Esparza, and Jacob Frankel

Introduction  
The purpose of our project is to create an interactive webmap that shows the location of various organizations that offer free services to the public and displays information about them. The point is to allow people to be able to use this webmap as a tool when deciding if they want to reach out to these organizations to take advantage of their services. The webmap consists of a basemap that shows the city and the surrounding area, and each organization has a marker that will result in a popup displaying information about it when clicked. The user will be able to compare their proximity to different organizations and will be able to compare the services offered by said organizations, and will be able to make more informed decisions on where to go. Worcester is a fastly growing city, and many of its residents don’t know about organizations that operate in areas that they don’t normally spend time in. In addition, Worcester has a large population of people who have been continually underserved and neglected by municipal services, and need information on where to go for healthcare, food services, housing assistance, and youth services. This webmap hopes to give people a place to go to find all the information they need in one place.
 
Data and Methodology  
What data did you acquire to complete your project? 
The webmap has a basemap from leaflet.js. Each individual 
Data Sources (How did you obtain the data?) 
Collect it by yourself? 
Obtain it from agencies or other sources?  If so, identify the source. 
What analyses did you undertake, if any? 
What Web Mapping technology or software did you use?
In this section, provide a conceptual framework (flow chart) if possible. 
Make sure you know the difference between conceptual framework and workflow.

Give an overview of the project’s purpose and how a user would get benefit from your map.
Describe the preprocessing steps and tools you employed in preparing the data for web map use.
Demonstrate how the data is divided into base maps and thematic layers.
Describe the approaches you took for exposing the data as web services and why you chose those approaches (e.g., dynamically drawn service using WMS, tiles designed with TileMill, tiles pulled from OpenStreetMap, GeoJSON layer drawn by the browser, etc.).
Demonstrate the interactive elements in your web map. 
Follow the "story" of what a user would do when approaching your map. For example: "Suppose that you are working for _____ and you want to learn ____, so you come to this map and see that you can turn on layer ______ which tells you _______. You then see that ______ is clickable, so you click it and learn that _______ is ________. You now know _________, which helps you make a decision about _______." In short, sell your product to me!
Describe at least one tool or technique used to create your web map that was not covered in the course materials.

Results 
Compare the final stage to when we did the assessment and to the initial proposal, identifying parts that are covered or not completed.
